## this is my Project : PREDICT()
that's to predict the stock by using API form Tradingview (tvDatafeed) 
then using Linear regression to calculate from the old data 
by using timestem as X of the the graph
and close-prices as Y 
we have only 2 variable

then the result is to show the graph linear that plot overlap with real graph (but now can not plot graph, import import matplotlib.pyplot as plt first)
i use html file to popup in one pages
